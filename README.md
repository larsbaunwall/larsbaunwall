## Hi, I am Lars üëã

I am part dreamer, part realist. Overly optimistic, and a genuine pessimist. I value the beauty in imperfection and the perfection in beauty.

I love most things tech, grew up in .NET, work on a mac, live in Denmark, and work for a most wonderful toy company. 

### Projects üå±

Currently, I am playing around with [DomainLang](https://github.com/larsbaunwall/DomainLang), which aims to be DSL, model, architecture graph, and anything in between, in the Domain-Driven Design space.

A couple of years ago, I did a small discovery project, diving a bit more into the electron stack, curious on how I might use web technology for cross-platform desktop apps. That was quite fun, and out of that work came [plodo](https://github.com/larsbaunwall/plodo), you should check that out too.
