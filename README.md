## Hi there, I'm Lars 👋

I am part dreamer, part realist. Overly optimistic, and a genuine pessimist. I value the beauty in imperfection and the perfection in beauty.

I've been building software for years — grew up in the .NET ecosystem, now work on a Mac, and call Denmark home. These days, I'm helping shape the digital future at one of the largest banks in the Nordics. When I'm not doing that, I'm usually tinkering with side projects or exploring new ideas.

### What I'm working on 🌱

**[DomainLang](https://github.com/DomainLang/DomainLang)** — My current passion project (when time allows). It's a DSL for Domain-Driven Design that bridges the gap between domain models, architecture diagrams, and living documentation.

**[Copilot Bridge](https://github.com/larsbaunwall/vscode-copilot-bridge)** — A VS Code extension I built that lets you use GitHub Copilot with your local tools. It's found a great community of users and continues to grow!

**[plodo](https://github.com/larsbaunwall/plodo)** — An earlier experiment where I explored Electron and cross-platform desktop development using web technologies. A fun learning journey.
